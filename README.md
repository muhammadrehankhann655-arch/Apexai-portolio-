Netrava is a logic-based AI architecture that eliminates the need for high-power brute-force processing. Unlike traditional AI that searches all data simultaneously, Netrava uses a Central Brain Router to send signals directly to specific data layers (Math, Vision, Security).
⚡ Performance Metrics (Mobile Simulation):
Logic Decision Speed: 0.01ms to 0.05ms.
Efficiency: Reduces power consumption by only activating relevant logic layers.
Key Feature: 3D Self-correction & Instant Memory Recall.
Developed entirely on a mobile environment to prove that high-level AI logic doesn't require a lab, just a brain.
